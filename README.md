# Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes

This repository contains an implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The Naive Bayes algorithm is based on Bayes' theorem, making strong assumptions about the independence of features, hence the name "naive."

Introduction
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a simple yet effective algorithm for text classification and other tasks where feature independence can be assumed. It calculates the probability of a data point belonging to a specific class based on the probabilities of its features given that class.

Installation
To use the Naive Bayes Classifier, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install this package using pip
